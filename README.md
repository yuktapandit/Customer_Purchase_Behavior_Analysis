🔍 Steps Performed
  1. Data Preparation & Cleaning
  
    - Imported dataset using Pandas.
    
    - Checked structure with .info() and summary stats with .describe().
    
    - Handled missing values in review_rating via median imputation.
    
    - Renamed columns to snake_case for readability.
    
    - Created additional features:
    
        - age_group (binned by age)
        
        - purchase_frequency_days (derived from transaction data)
    
    - Dropped redundant column promo_code_used after consistency checks.
  
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
    - Examined purchase trends, seasonal variations, and discount effects.
    
    - Analyzed demographic impact on spending behavior.
    
    - Visualized correlations and category performance using Matplotlib.
  
  3. SQL Data Analysis
  
    - Key business questions answered using MySQL queries:
    
        - Revenue comparison by gender
        
        - High-spending discount users
        
        - Top 5 products by average rating
        
        - Average spend by shipping type (Standard vs. Express)
        
        - Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers revenue analysis
        
        - Top discounted products
        
        - Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
        
        - Top 3 products per category
        
        - Repeat buyers vs. subscription rate
        
        - Revenue contribution by age group
  
  4. Power BI Dashboard
  
    - Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:
  
        - Revenue distribution across demographics
        
        - Category and seasonal performance
        
        - Customer segmentation and loyalty insights
        
        - Subscription-based revenue trends
        
        - Discount and rating correlations

📊 Results & Insights

  - Subscribers spend significantly more than non-subscribers.
  
  - Loyal customers drive consistent, high-value revenue.
  
  - Express shipping users make larger purchases.
  
  - Top-rated products show strong correlation with repeat buying.
  
  - Discounts effectively boost sales but require profit margin monitoring.
